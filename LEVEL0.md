## Task 1 History of aviation-Quiz

This task is meant to teach the theory of aviation and the different types of planes in a more theoretical manner but by making it more hands-on by showing models by going and visiting the aviation domain. This gives the students a brief of the history and the approach taken by the pioneers of the department.

**Resource Link:**
https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-flight/Other-aviation-pioneers
The quiz will be based on history and simple concepts based on this!

**Expected Outcome:**
Understand the past of the aviation domain.
See the different parts of different planes with their technical names
See the thought process of thinking that led to aviation.



## Task 2- Simulation Flying

 
**Flying a drone on the simulator, landing the drone successfully**

The students will be exposed to the simple maneuvers and the importance of line of sight in flying a UAV. As the simulator will be real life it will show how fast and far a drone can go how the axis will rotate and the difficulties of flying one.


**Software:**

TO BE INSTALLED AND FURTHER UPDATED

**Hardware:**
Transmitter which can be used on the software
Wires to connect the transmitter to the PC

WILL BE UPDATED BASED ON SIMULATOR AND TRANSMITTER

**Expected Outcome:**
Understanding different configurations of planes and UAVs.
The environmental conditions important on the flight
The movements and maneuvers of the UAV/Drone
The modes of the transmitter 
Learning how to use a transmitter

## Task 3 - Design an airfoil in Fusion 360 of NACA 4412 airfoil coordinates

Use the DAT to spline converter or the canvas tool to sketch the airfoil using an image.

Learn about different terms in an airfoil like angle of attack,camber line,chord line and leading edge. Have a clear understanding of how tweaking these parameters affects the performance of the airfoil.

**The design should include two types one using the wood environment and the other using composites. Design the airfoil with space efficient and 3d printable internal ribs.The wing should generate at least 5 newtons of lift at a wind speed of 25m/s.**

**Prerequisite:** Autodesk student 


## TASK - 4 : Write an article on REAL WORLD APPLICATION

Learn more about a specific application of the drone, write an article to explain and learn from that application

Try learning what other prerequisites are there for applying these applications (**QGIS application,IOT protocols and ROS**)

Eg- Farmming, Brdiges health checkups, surveillance and many more!
