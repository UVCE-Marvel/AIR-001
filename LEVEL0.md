# Level 1
## Task 1 History of aviation+Quiz
This task is meant to teach the theory of aviation and the different types of planes in a more theoretical manner but by making it more hands-on by showing models by going and visiting the aviation department. This gives the students a brief of the history and the approach taken by the pioneers of the department.


**Resource Link:**
https://aero.iisc.ac.in/ 

This is the IISC aerospace department 
We know a few of the interns and students of the IISC aerospace department, that we can contact.

**Expected Outcome:**
* Understand the past of the aviation department.
* See the different parts of different planes with their technical names
* See the thought process of thinking that led to aviation.

## Task 2- Simulation Flying 
### Flying drones on simulator , fly it go far off and come back with a successful landing on the ground
The students will be exposed to the simple maneuvers and the importance of line of sight in flying a UAV. As the simulator will be real life it will show how fast and far a drone can go how the axis will rotate and the difficulties of flying one.

##### Software:
There are many software in the market but most are expensive. An example of a cheap one will be:
**SimPro Drone Flight Simulator**

##### Hardware:
Transmitter which can be used on the software
Wires to connect the transmitter to the PC

### Expected Outcome:
* Understanding different configurations of planes and UAVs.
* The environmental conditions important on the flight
* The movements and maneuvers of the UAV/Drone
* The modes of the transmitter 
* Learning how to use a transmitter
## Task 3 - Design an airfoil in Fusion 360 of NACA 4412 airfoil coordinates

Use the DAT to spline converter or the canvas tool to sketch the airfoil using an image.


Learn about different terms in an airfoil like angle of attack,camber line,chord line and leading edge. Have a clear understanding of how tweaking these parameters affects the performance of the airfoil.


**The design should include two types one using the wood environment and the other using composites. Design the airfoil with space efficient and 3d printable internal ribs.The wing should generate at least 5 newtons of lift at a wind speed of 25m/s.**

## TASK - 4 : REAL WORLD APPLICATION

Learn more about data extraction from drone


( A sample image of a pomegranate farm, helping to understand the yield)


**Using QGIS software**
Here different aiml topics like linear regression, computer vision(yolo model), segmentation model are used.
