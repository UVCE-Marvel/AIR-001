## Task 2 - Mission Possible

Using a UAV, connect the mission planner and FC either by telemetry or wired. Now set up and configure the UAV based on its physical features and sensors. Put a geofence around UVCE so it doesn't go outside and plan a small autonomous flight with the coordinator.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Understand why we use Mission Planner.
- Learn about some of the major features of Mission Planner.

**Takeaways:**
- Learn the importance and be able to automate UAVs.
- Learn how to set a geofence.
- Learn the connections and configurations.

**Resources:**

## Task 3 - Designing Propellers

Design a propeller blade to generate a lift of around 9 newtons. Design both clockwise and counterclockwise blades. Be mindful of the leading and trailing edges on the blades. Run a simulation on CFD to generate a detailed report.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- The toroidal propeller should match the dimensions of the propeller blades in Marvel, and the internal threading should fit tightly over the shaft of the BLDC motor.
- 3D print the toroidal propeller with appropriate support structures.
- Provide a sample of the toroidal propeller to the Marvel Lab.

**Takeaways:**
- Learn about different types of propellers.
- Understand the physics behind propellers.
- Be able to use CFD and Fusion 360.
