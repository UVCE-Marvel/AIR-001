## Task 1 - Flying the Airblock drone
With the help of a coordinator fly the airblock. This will be a super fun experince, do fly safely and take care of the surroundings.

Expected Outcome:
To learn the basic protocols of flying
Learning the basic safety standards and protocols
Being able to land the drone

Takeaways:
FLYING an UAV, understanding the forces in play

Resources:

1. App for airblock: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.makeblock.makeblock&hl=en
	
2. Guide: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://download.makeblock.com/AirblockAPP-EN.pdf
 
## Task 2 - Mission Possible
Using UAV, connect the mission planner and FC either by telemetry or wired. Now setup and configure the UAV based on its physical 
feautures and sensors. Now put a geofence around UVCE, so it doesnt go outside and plan a small autonomous flight, with the coordinator.
	
Expected Outcomes:
Why we use mission planner?
What are some of the major features of mission planner?

Takeaways:
Learn the importance and being able to automate our UAV's
Learning how to put geofence
Learning the connections and configurations

## Task 3 - Designing Propellors

Design a propellor blade to generate a lift of around 9 newtons. Design both clockwise and counterclockwise blades.Make sure to be mindful of the leading and trailing edge on the blades.Run a simulation on CFD to calculate a detailed report on the same.

Expected outcomes:
The toroidal propellor should match with the dimensions of the propellor blades in marvel and the internal threading should be such that it fits tightly over the shaft of the BLDC motor.
3D print the toroidal propellor with appropriate support structures.Furnish a sample of the toroidal propellor to the Marvel Lab.

Takeaways:
Learning the different types of propellors
Learning the physics behind it
Being able to use CFD and fusion 360

## Task 4 - Assembling Drone using Ecalc
Write about different materials to assemble a drone with an empty weight of 800g. State the reason behind material selection and endurance
Now using this calculate the thrust and battery esc and the other materials needed for the drone.

Resources:

1. Ecalc: its free but only few configurations available: https://www.ecalc.ch/
	
2. Study notes: TO BE MADE BY ADITYA!

Expected Outcomes:
Being able to understand the proccess of designing a drone
Learning about payload and thrust 
How to calculate weight 
Ratio of thrust to weight needed

Takeaways:
Being able to design a drone based on any project
Understanding the importance of battery and thrust
Being able to read data sheets of motors

## Task 5 - REGULATIONS OF DGCA
Learn more about ICAO, SARPS, QCI, BIS, stakeholders and their basic laws.
Go through AIP.
